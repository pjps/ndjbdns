                                   ==========


          Hello all,

               I  am  pleased  to  release  this  *new* djbdns version
          1.05.7. Djbdns is a fully‐fledged Domain  Name  System(DNS),
          originally  written  by the eminent author of qmail, Dr. D J
          Bernstein. This new release is a complete  makeover  to  the
          original source(djbdns‐1.05) and is meant to make life a lot
          more pleasant. The original source is in public‐domain since
          late Dec 2007.

              Please see: http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html

          Nevertheless,  this new release is distributed under the GNU
          General Public Licence for  good.  See  ChangeLog  for  more
          details.

          Installation:
          ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

          To install djbdns: just say

               sh>$ autoreconf ‐if     # to generate configure script.
               sh>$ ./configure [ ‐‐prefix=/usr/local ]
               sh>$ make
               sh># make install

          Once  installed,  On  Linux  machines  add ‘dnscache’ to the
          system services by following steps. Note that, if you  chose
          a different install prefix with ‘‐‐prefix’, use that instead
          of the default ‐ /usr/local.

               sh># mv /usr/local/bin/dnscached /etc/init.d/dnscached
               sh># chkconfig ‐‐add dnscached
               sh># chkconfig ‐‐list dnscached


          Now you can start the service by

               sh># service dnscached start
                        OR
               sh># dnscache ‐D

          Consult the dnscache(8) manual page for more help.
